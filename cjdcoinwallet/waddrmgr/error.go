// ManagerErr provides a single type for errors that can happen during address
// manager operation.  It is used to indicate several types of failures
// including errors with caller requests such as invalid accounts or requesting
// private keys against a locked address manager, errors with the database
// (ErrDatabase), errors with key chain derivation (ErrKeyChain), and errors
// related to crypto (ErrCrypto).
//
// The caller can use type assertions to determine if an error is a ManagerError
// and access the ErrorCode field to ascertain the specific reason for the
// failure.
//
// The ErrDatabase, ErrKeyChain, and ErrCrypto error codes will also have the
// Err field set with the underlying error.
